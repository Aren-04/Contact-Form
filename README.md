# Contact-Form

This is a simple and clean contact form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It checks that the user fills in their name, email, and message correctly before allowing the form to submit. If something’s missing or the email doesn’t look right, it shows helpful error messages. Once everything’s filled in properly, it shows a success message—no actual data is sent, just a smooth user experience with friendly feedback.
